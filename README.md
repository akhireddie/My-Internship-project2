Creating an entire project involves significant time and resources, and it's beyond the scope of a chat response. However, I can provide you with a basic outline to help you get started:

Project Structure:

Create a Java project with appropriate packages.
Consider using a build tool like Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies.URLShortener Class:

Implement a URLShortener class responsible for shortening and expanding URLs.
Include methods for generating a short URL, expanding a short URL, and handling collisions.
Hash Function:

Design a basic hash function for generating unique short URLs.
Ensure it produces reasonably unique identifiers to minimize collisions.Error Handling:

Implement error-handling mechanisms for scenarios like duplicate long URLs and invalid short URLs.
Provide meaningful user feedback for better usability.
Data Persistence (Optional):

Consider persisting data to maintain link mappings between sessions.
Choose a simple storage solution like a file system or a lightweight database.User Interface:

Develop a simple command-line interface (CLI) or a basic web-based interface for user interaction.
CLI can involve taking user input and displaying results, while a web interface might use basic HTML forms.
Documentation:

Create a brief document explaining your design choices, features, and any challenges encountered during development.Testing:

Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your URLShortener class.
Test edge cases and error scenarios to verify the robustness of your implementation
